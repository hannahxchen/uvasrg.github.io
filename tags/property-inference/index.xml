      <description>(Cross-post by Anshuman Suri)
Inference attacks seek to infer sensitive information about the training process of a revealed machine-learned model, most often about the training data.
Standard inference attacks (which we call “dataset inference attacks”) aim to learn something about a particular record that may have been in that training data. For example, in a membership inference attack (Reza Shokri et al., Membership Inference Attacks Against Machine Learning Models, IEEE S&amp;amp;P 2017), the adversary aims to infer whether or not a particular record was included in the training data.</description>
