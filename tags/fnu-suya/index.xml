      <description>How does a poisoning attack work and why are some groups more susceptible to being victimized by a poisoning attack?
We&amp;rsquo;ve posted work that helps understand how poisoning attacks work with some engaging visualizations:
Poisoning Attacks and Subpopulation Susceptibility
An Experimental Exploration on the Effectiveness of Poisoning Attacks
Evan Rose, Fnu Suya, and David Evans
 
Follow the link to try the interactive version!   Machine learning is susceptible to poisoning attacks in which adversaries inject maliciously crafted training data into the training set to induce specific model behavior.</description>

      <description>(Post by Sean Miller, using images adapted from Suya&amp;rsquo;s talk slides)
Data Poisoning Attacks Machine learning models are often trained using data from untrusted sources, leaving them open to poisoning attacks where adversaries use their control over a small fraction of that training data to poison the model in a particular way.
Most work on poisoning attacks is directly driven by an attacker&amp;rsquo;s objective, where the adversary chooses poisoning points that maximize some target objective.</description>

      <description>New: Video Presentation
Finding Black-box Adversarial Examples with Limited Queries Black-box attacks generate adversarial examples (AEs) against deep neural networks with only API access to the victim model.
Existing black-box attacks can be grouped into two main categories:
  Transfer Attacks use white-box attacks on local models to find candidate adversarial examples that transfer to the target model.
  Optimization Attacks use queries to the target model and apply optimization techniques to search for adversarial examples.</description>
