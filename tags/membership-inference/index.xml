      <description>Congratulations to Anshuman Suri for successfully defending his PhD thesis!&#xA;Tianhao Wang, Dr. Anshuman Suri, Nando Fioretto, Cong Shen&#xA;On Screen: David Evans, Giuseppe Ateniese Inference Privacy in Machine Learning Using machine learning models comes at the risk of leaking information about data used in their training and deployment. This leakage can expose sensitive information about properties of the underlying data distribution, data from participating users, or even individual records in the training data.</description>

      <description>Anshuman Suri wrote up an interesting post on his experience with the MICO Challenge, a membership inference competition that was part of SaTML. Anshuman placed second in the competition (on the CIFAR data set), where the metric is highest true positive rate at a 0.1 false positive rate over a set of models (some trained using differential privacy and some without).&#xA;Anshuman&amp;rsquo;s post describes the methods he used and his experience in the competition: My submission to the MICO Challenge.</description>
