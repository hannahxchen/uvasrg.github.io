      <description>How does a poisoning attack work and why are some groups more susceptible to being victimized by a poisoning attack?
We&amp;rsquo;ve posted work that helps understand how poisoning attacks work with some engaging visualizations:
Poisoning Attacks and Subpopulation Susceptibility
An Experimental Exploration on the Effectiveness of Poisoning Attacks
