      <description>I gave an invited talk at the Distributed and Private Machine Learning (DPML) workshop at ICLR 2021 on Inference Risks for Machine Learning.
  The talk mostly covers work by Bargav Jayaraman on evaluating privacy in machine learning and connecting attribute inference and imputation, and recent work by Anshuman Suri on property inference.</description>

      <description>Here are the slides for my talk at the 11th ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy:
 When Models Learn Too Much [PDF]   The talk includes Bargav Jayaraman&amp;rsquo;s work (with Katherine Knipmeyer, Lingxiao Wang, and Quanquan Gu) on evaluating privacy in machine learning, as well as more recent work by Anshuman Suri on property inference attacks, and Bargav on attribute inference and imputation:
