### ScriptInspector: Monitoring Embedded Web Scripts"

Modern web applications make frequent use of third-party scripts,
often in ways that allow scripts loaded from external servers to make
unrestricted changes to the embedding page and access citical
resources including private user information.

**ScriptInspector** assists site administrators in understanding,
monitoring, and restricting the behavior of third-party scripts embedded
in their site.  ScriptInspector is a modified browser that can
intercept, record, and check third-party script accesses to critical
resources against security policies.  It works with a **Visualizer**
tool that allows users to conveniently view recorded script behaviors
and candidate policies and a **PolicyGenerator** tool that aids script
providers and site administrators in writing policies.  Site
administrators can manually refine these policies with minimal effort to
produce policies that effectively and robustly limit the behavior of
embedded scripts.
