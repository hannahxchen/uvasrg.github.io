The work by Bargav Jayaraman (with Katherine Knipmeyer, Lingxiao Wang,
and Quanquan Gu) that I talked about on improving membership inference
attacks is described in more details here:

The work on distribution inference is described in this paper (by Anshuman Suri):

- [_Formalizing and Estimating Distribution Inference Risks_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06024)  
[[Blog]](https://uvasrg.github.io/on-the-risks-of-distribution-inference/) [Code: [_https://github.com/iamgroot42/form_est_dist_risks_](https://github.com/iamgroot42/form_est_dist_risks)]

The work on attribute inference and imputation isn't yet posted, but feel free to contact me with any questions about it.
