<a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~havron/">Sam Havron</a> (BSCS 2017) is quoted in [an article in Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/eva-galperin-stalkerware-kaspersky-antivirus/) on eradicating stalkerware: 

> The full extent of that stalkerware crackdown will only prove out with time and testing, says Sam Havron, a Cornell researcher who worked on last year's spyware study. Much more work remains. He notes that domestic abuse victims can also be tracked with dual-use apps often overlooked by antivirus firms, like antitheft software Cerberus. Even innocent tools like Apple's Find My Friends and Google Maps' location-sharing features can be abused if they don't better communicate to users that they may have been secretly configured to share their location. "This is really exciting news," Havron says of Kaspersky's stalkerware change. "Hopefully it will spur the rest of the industry to follow suit. But it's just the very first thing."
