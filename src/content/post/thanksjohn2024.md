Maggie Makar organized a celebration for the 75th birthday of my PhD advisor, [John Guttag](https://people.csail.mit.edu/guttag/). 

I wasn't able to attend in person, unfortunately, but the occasion provided an opportunity to create a poster that looks back on what I've done since I started working with John over 30 years ago.
