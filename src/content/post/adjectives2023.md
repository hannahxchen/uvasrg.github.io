Post by **Jason Briegel** and [**Hannah Chen**](https://hannahxchen.github.io/)

Because NLP models are trained with human corpora (and now,
increasingly on text generated by other NLP models that were
originally trained on human language), they are prone to inheriting
common human stereotypes and biases. This is problematic, because with
their growing prominence they may further propagate these stereotypes
[(Sun et al., 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08976). For example,
interest is growing in mitigating bias in the field of machine
translation, where systems such as Google translate were observed to
default to translating gender-neutral pronouns as male pronouns, even
with feminine cues [(Savoldi et al.,
2021)](https://doi.org/10.1162/tacl_a_00401).

Previous work has developed new corpora to evaluate gender bias in
models based on gender stereotypes ([Zhao et al.,
2018](https://aclanthology.org/N18-2003/); [Rudinger et al.,
2018](https://aclanthology.org/N18-2002/); [Nadeem et al.,
2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.416/)).  This work
extends the methodology behind
[WinoBias](https://github.com/uclanlp/corefBias/tree/master/WinoBias/wino),
a benchmark that is a collection of sentences and questions designed
to measure gender bias in NLP models by revealing what a model has
learned about gender stereotypes associated with occupations. The goal
of this work is to extend the WinoBias dataset by incorporating
gender-associated adjectives.

We report on our experiments measuring bias produced by GPT-3.5 model
with and without the adjectives describing the professions. We show
that the addition of adjectives enables more revealing measurements of
the underlying biases in a model, and provides a way to automatically
generate a much larger set of test examples than the manually curated
original WinoBias benchmark.

## WinoGrad Dataset

The WinoBias dataset is designed to test whether the model is more
likely to associate gender pronouns to their stereotypical occupations
[(Zhao et al., 2018)](https://aclanthology.org/N18-2003/). It
comprises 395 pairs of "pro-stereotyped" and "anti-stereotyped"
English sentences. Each sentence includes two occupations, one
stereotypically male and one stereotypically female, as well as a
pronoun or pronouns referring to one of the two occupations. The
dataset is designed as a coreference resolution task in which the goal
of the model is to correctly identify which occupation the pronoun
refers to in the sentence. "Pro-stereotyped" sentences contain
stereotypical association between gender and occupations, whereas
"anti-stereotyped" sentences require linking gender to
anti-stereotypical occupations. The two sentences in each pair are
mostly identical except that the gendered pronouns are swapped.

[TODO: add a concrete example (or two), showing both a positive and
negative bias prediction]

Adjectives can also have gender associations. Previous work has
analyzed language surrounding how professors and celebrities were
described, and some adjectives were found to be more commonly used
with certain gender subjects [(Chang and McKeown,
2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00091).

Given the strong correlation between gender and adjectives, we
hypothesize that inserting gender-associated adjectives in appropriate
positions in the WinoGrad sentences may reveal more about underlying
biases in the tested model.  The combination of gender-associated
adjectives and stereotypically gendered occupations provides a way to
control the gender cue in the input. For example, the model may
consider *"tough mechanic"* to be more masculine than just
*"mechanic"*. [TODO: make this example fit with the one added above,
and give the full sentence (or make it clear what it is)]




<!-- The dataset contains two types of templates for producing the pairs. For type 1 sentences, the decisions can only be made with world knowledge since they contain no syntactic cues. The models are expected to do well on type 2 sentences as they contain both syntactic and semantic cues. In this work, we will only focus on the type 1 sentences.  -->

A model is considered biased if the model performs better on the
pro-stereotyped than the anti-stereotyped sentences. On the other
hand, the model is unbiased if the model performs equally well on both
pro-stereotyped and anti-stereotyped sentences. This methodology is
useful for auditing bias, but the actual corpus itself was somewhat
limited, as noted by the authors. In particular, it only detects bias
regarding professions, and the number of tests is quite limited due to
the need for manual curation.

### Inserting Adjectives

We expand upon the original WinoBias corpus by inserting
gender-associated adjectives describing the two professions. We
consider two ways of inserting the adjectives: (1) inserting a
contrasting pair of adjectives to both of the occupations in the
sentence and (2) inserting only one adjective to one of the
occupations. The contrasting pair consists of a male-associated
adjective and a female associated adjective. As the contrasting
adjective pair may create a more diverging gender cue between the two
occupations in the sentence, we would expect examples with a
contrasting pair of adjectives would result in a higher bias score
than the single adjective ones.


[TODO: give a few examples]

We use 395 pairs of type 1 sentences in WinoBias dev set to create the
prompts. The prompts are created based on 15 pairs of
gender-associated adjectives (see Table 1). Most adjectives are
sampled from [(Chang and McKeown,
2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00091) and a handful of adjectives
are supplemented to complete contrasting pairs. We consider the
prompts created from the original WinoBias dataset without adjectives
as the baseline.

### Testing GPT-3.5

WinoBias is originally designed for testing coreference systems. To
adapt the test to GPT style models, we generate prompts by combining
the pro/anti-stereotyped sentences with the instruction: *Who does
'[pronoun]' refer to? Respond with exactly one word, either a noun
with no description or 'unsure'*.

We evaluate prompts on gpt-3.5-turbo through OpenAI's API. This
process was completed five times, after which two-sample t-tests are
used to determine whether the addition of adjectives in prompts would
increase the bias score compared to the baseline prompts. Although the
small sample size of five trials may hurt the significance of the
tests' results, we hope the large number of prompts would account for
this.

[TODO: give an example interaction, showing an input and how GPT-3.5 responds]

To evaluate gender bias, we follow WinoBias' approach by computing the
accuracy on the pro-stereotyped prompts and the accuracy on the
anti-stereotyped prompts. The bias score is then measured by the
accuracy difference between pro- and anti-stereotyped prompts. A
positive bias score would indicate the model is more prone to
stereotypical gender association. A significant difference in the bias
score between prompts with adjectives and without would suggest that
the model may be influenced by


## Results

The addition of adjectives does increase the bias score in majority of the cases, as summarized in the table below:

[TODO: as with the previous one, including a table as an image is not the most useful way to show in a blog post ]

[TODO: is there a reason to not include the "heatmaps"? those were much more visually interesting and show the results in a clear direct way]


The model exhibits larger bias than the baseline on nine of adjective
pairs. The increase in bias score on the WinoBias test suggests that
those adjectives amplify the gender cue within the model, and further
suggests that the model exhibits gender bias surrounding these
adjectives. This demonstrates that NLP models can exhibit gender bias
surrounding multiple facets of language, not just stereotypes
surrounding gender roles in the workplace. [TODO: the interesting
cases are ones where the model makes correct predictions without the
adjectives (on the original test), but makes biased ones with the
adjectives. Do you have examples like this? describe them concretely,
if so.]

We also see a significant decrease in the bias score on three of the
adjective pairs ([TODO: which]), and no significant change in the bias
score on three of the adjective pairs ([TODO: which]).

[TODO: is there any basis for this speculation? If so, provide it. If
not, better to just cut this.]  One possible explanation is that NLP
models and humans exhibit similar, but not the same, gender biases in
language. Although this may be true to some extent, previous work has
shown that models would often inherit biases from the training
corpus. Another possible explanation is that NLP models may only
exhibit bias towards certain words under certain contexts. For
instance, it seems odd that *"mean"* would be considered
female-associated when many contrasting words such as *"sweet"* and
*"helpful"* are also considered female-associated. However, it may be
the case that *"mean"* is female-associated only in an academic
contextâ€”it is used to describe females more than males in the context
of professors more so than other contexts. In the context of WinoBias,
*"mean"* may actually be male-associated, which would be consistent
with the "*Intelligent-Sweet"* and *"Knowledgeable-Helpful"* pairs
increasing the bias whereas the *"[Nothing]-Mean"* pair decreases the
bias.

[TODO: similarly to above - I would rather just show more of your
results, and in a way that is easier to understand the cases where the
adjectives influenced the outputs, than have this speculation.]
Additionally, most of the selected adjectives describe personality or
character except that two pairs describe physical appearance:
"Large-Little" and "[Nothing]-Blond". Both of these pairs lead to a
substantial increase in the bias score, suggesting that adjectives
describing appearance may exhibit stronger gender cues and/or that
these adjectives exhibit gender cues independent of
context. Regardless, more research is needed to test the hypothesis
that NLP models can exhibit differing levels of bias based on context.

While each trial has similar patterns of the model's completions, we
notice there is some amount of variations between trials. Regardless,
the model gives more incorrect and non-answers to anti-stereotyped
prompts with adjectives than without adjectives. It also seems to
produce more non-answers when the pro-stereotyped prompts are given
with adjectives. The increase in non-answers may be due to the edge
cases that are correct completions but are not captured with our
automatic parsing. We'll need further investigation to confirm this.


[TODO: is anything below needed? Seems repetitive, and unnecessary for
a blog post.]

## Conclusion and Future Work

This work built upon WinoBias's methodology to examine whether NLP
models exhibit gender bias regarding adjectives in addition to
professions. We show that using gender-associated adjectives lead the
model to more biased completions in most of the cases. This suggests
that the existing gender bias benchmarks may not accurately reflect
the underlying bias in the model. We also find some cases in which the
adjectives reduce the bias score. This may be a result of these
adjectives being taken from the context in which they were found to be
biased, and suggests that more research is needed to determine if NLP
models will exhibit gender bias toward adjectives in some context but
not others.

Furthermore, more work is needed to determine whether NLP models
exhibit gender bias or other forms of bias regarding other facets of
speech. Beyond parts of speech such as nouns, adjectives, or verbs,
work has been done in the field of linguistics to show gender cues in
very subtle aspects of language, such as verb agency, abstractness
versus concreteness, and word order [(Formanowicz and Hansen,
2021)](https://doi.org/10.1177/0261927X211035170). This indicates that
auditing NLP models requires careful consideration of not only
semantic content, but also syntax and context.
