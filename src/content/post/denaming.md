This blog was started in [January 2008](/2008/facebook-privacy.html), a bit over
eight years after I started as a professor at UVA and initiated the
research group. It was named after Thomas Jefferson's cipher wheel,
which [has long
been](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs588-fall2001/challenges/wheel-solved.html)
(and [remains](https://github.com/evansuva/cipherschool)) one of my
[favorite ways to introduce
cryptography](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/crypto/day1-jefferson.html).

Figuring out how to honor our history, including Jefferson's founding
of the University, and appreciate his
[ideals](https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/virginia-statute-religious-freedom)
and [enormous
contributions](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/declaration.html),
while confronting the reality of Jefferson as a slave owner and
abuser, will be a challenge and responsibility for people above my
administrative rank. But, I've come to see that it is harmful to have
a blogged named after Jefferson so have removed the Jefferson's Wheel
name from this research group blog.

For now, we're going with a very generic "uvasrg" name...but hopefully
will come up with something more interesting eventually.  (I've
reluctantly rejected "Hamilton's Dual", alluding, of course, to
[Margaret
Hamilton](https://www.amazon.com/Margaret-Moon-Dean-Robbins/dp/0399551859)
and [William Rown
Hamilton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZXHoWwBcDc), of course, and
the Lagranian Dual and [Dual
Execution](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/pubs/oakland2012/), not
to [any historical rival of
Jefferson's](https://www.history.com/news/alexander-hamilton-slavery-facts).)
