The talk is mostly about Bargav Jayaraman's work (with Katherine Knipmeyer, Lingxiao Wang, and Quanquan Gu) on evaluating privacy:

- [_Merlin, Morgan, and the Importance of Thresholds and Priors_](/merlin-morgan-and-the-importance-of-thresholds-and-priors/)
- [_Evaluating Differentially Private Machine Learning in Practice_](/evaluating-differentially-private-machine-learning-in-practice/)
