I gave an invited talk at the [Distributed and Private Machine Learning](https://dp-ml.github.io/2021-workshop-ICLR/) (DPML) workshop at ICLR 2021 on [_Inference Risks for Machine Learning_](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2021/workshop/2148#collapse3549).

The talk mostly covers work by Bargav Jayaraman on evaluating privacy in
machine learning and connecting attribute inference and imputation, and recent work by Anshuman Suri on property inference.
