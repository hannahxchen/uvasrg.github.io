How does a poisoning attack work and why are some groups more
susceptible to being victimized by a poisoning attack?

We've posted work that helps understand how poisoning attacks work

[Poisoning Attacks and Subpopulation Susceptibility](/poisoning)  
_An Experimental Exploration on the Effectiveness of Poisoning Attacks_
Evan Rose, Fnu Suya, and David Evans

Follow [the link](/poisoning) for the paper and interactive visualizations, but you can start with the first visualization below.
