      <description>Post by Bargav Jayaraman
  Attribute inference attacks have been shown by prior works to pose privacy threat against ML models. However, these works assume the knowledge of the training distribution and we show that in such cases these attacks do no better than a data imputataion attack that does not have access to the model. We explore the attribute inference risks in the cases where the adversary has limited or no prior knowledge of the training distribution and show that our white-box attribute inference attack (that uses neuron activations to infer the unknown sensitive attribute) surpasses imputation in these data constrained cases.</description>

      <description>Post by Hannah Chen.
Our work on balanced adversarial training looks at how to train models that are robust to two different types of adversarial examples:

   Adversarial Examples At the broadest level, an adversarial example is an input crafted intentionally to confuse a model.</description>

      <description>How does a poisoning attack work and why are some groups more susceptible to being victimized by a poisoning attack?
We&amp;rsquo;ve posted work that helps understand how poisoning attacks work with some engaging visualizations:
